A project regarded as my final homework of the course "The Principles And Technology Of Computer Communication".

This software is for network scaning.

Made by Qt 5.0.2 and libnet-1.2-rc2 and libpcap-1.4.0 under linux.

Have fun!

=========

The project is still not ready to run.Please wait.

	Now all the scanning functions can work together well. The rest of the works is interacting with GUI, which is just a piece of cake!
